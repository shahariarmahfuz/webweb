# Nebula Bazaar

Simple buy/sell marketplace demo with a lightweight admin panel. Designed for Railway deployment.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes

- Database credentials are embedded in `server.js` as requested for testing (no `.env`).
- Admin panel is available at `/admin.html` and has no authentication for now.
